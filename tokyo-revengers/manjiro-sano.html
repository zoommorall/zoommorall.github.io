                        <p>Manjiro Sano (佐野さの 万まん次じ郎ろう, Sanō Manjirō?), or Mikey (マイキー, Maikī?), is a
                            founding member
                            and the former leader (総長, Sōchō?) of the Tokyo Manji Gang. In a past timeline,
                            Mikey was
                            the leader of the Kanto Manji Gang. He is the deuteragonist and final antagonist
                            of the
                            Tokyo Revengers manga series and its anime adaptation.</p>
                        <img class="ib" src="su.png" alt="">
                        <p>Mikey is a teenager of below-average height with pitch-black piercing eyes and
                            long blonde
                            hair that is only tied at the top with the hair on the sides moving freely.</p>
                        <p>In the original timeline, adult Mikey's hair was slicked back, and he still had
                            his CB250T
                            motorcycle.</p>
                        <p>In his second appearance as an adult, Mikey appears with short black hair and a
                            dragon tattoo
                            on his neck similar to the ones Draken and Takashi Mitsuya have. He rides a
                            CB205T owned
                            previously by his brother, Shinichiro Sano.</p>
                        <p>In the latest present timeline, he has short white hair with a middle part
                            undercut hairstyle
                            and a Bonten tattoo on his nape with a design similar to his adoptive brother's,
                            Izana
                            Kurokawa's, earrings. He is noted to be thinner, deranged, and with heavy bags
                            under his
                            eyes.</p>
                        <p>In the final time leap, he has a short black hair which is parted at the middle.
                            He is seen
                            wearing a dark blue suit and a racing helmet and suit seen in a visualization of
                            Mikey
                            racing.</p>
                        <p>Mikey is usually a carefree teenager who loves to joke and play pranks around those he
                            considers his close friends. He cares for them greatly and is determined to protect their
                            honor. He rarely shows any sign of weakness, as he believes himself to be the foundation and
                            support for Toman, and if the pillar himself were to display weakness, Toman would also be
                            weakened.</p>
                        <p>As Toman's leader, his aura changes dramatically, becoming imposing and commanding. While
                            Toman's members respect Mikey, they also hold a degree of fear towards him and his immense
                            prowess.</p>

                        <h4>Adrenaline Surge</h4>
                        <p><i>When Mikey enters the Black Impulse, his stats increase manifold.</i></p>
                        <h4>Ignoring pain.</h4>
                        <p><i>When Mikey taps into the Black Impulse, he becomes impervious to physical damage inflicted
                                by his adversaries. This capability was vividly showcased during his showdown with Saus,
                                where despite the exchange of blows, Mikey remained unfazed by the onslaught, turning
                                the
                                tide of a battle where his opponent had previously held complete dominance over

                        <p><i>"When Mikey harnesses the power of the Black Impulse, he gains immunity to physical damage
                                from his adversaries. This ability was aptly showcased during his intense encounter with
                                Saus. Despite engaging in a fierce exchange of blows, Mikey emerged unscathed, defying
                                the damage inflicted by his opponent who had previously dominated Doraken."</i></p>
                        <h4>Total indifference.</h4>
                        <p><i>"When Mikey activates the Black Impulse, all his positive emotions are effectively
                                overridden, leaving him consumed by indifference, a craving for blood, and ruthless
                                composure. In this state, he shows no restraint even towards those close to him, as
                                evidenced by his actions, such as those against Takemichi."</i></p>
                        <h4>Negative Aura.</h4>
                        <p><i>"When Mike enters the Black Impulse, he emits an aura of a bloodthirsty killer, capable of
                                intimidating even formidable characters. This was vividly demonstrated, for instance,
                                with Senju. When Mike was fully consumed by darkness, the girl felt his indescribable
                                thirst for blood and experienced fear, even though she had previously been prepared to
                                continue fighting Terano."</i></p>

                    and tools you longed for.
                    <br>Screws, heavy pliers, delicate scales... At home, you tinkered with these instruments, utterly
                    immersed in the joy of creation.
                    <br>At five years old, you were endlessly curious about life: A mechanical bird that sang on its
                    own, a
                    dromas incubator, artificial flowers that stayed forever vibrant — you boldly declared you'd become
                    the most knowledgeable person in the world. Tsk, tsk. How rare it is for a child's grand boasts to
                    be taken seriously by their family.</i></p>

            <p><i>Later, she heard from passing merchants that there was an academy called the Grove of Epiphany, a
                    sacred place devoted to the pursuit of wisdom. You secretly memorized that name, thinking that if
                    you could one day go there with your sister, life wouldn't be so hard.
                    <br>Later still, she finally managed to raise enough travel funds and asked a merchant friend to
                    give
                    you a ride so you could go study at the Grove.
                    <br>Halfway along the journey, upon hearing that the black tide had struck, you hurriedly rushed
                    back —
                    the sight of that corroded ruin was truly unbearable to behold... Proud as you are, you even found
                    yourself kneeling on the ground. You weren't praying to the gods, were you..."</i></p>

            <p><i>"Stop flipping through my mind, you naughty Titan."</i>
                <br>The man snapped out of his reverie, and an emotion — indeterminable if it was either rage or sorrow
                — flickered in his right eye.
            </p>

            <p><i><b>"Sages of the Grove:</b></i></p>
            <p><i>Regarding how some scholars accuse me of the three great sins, 'academic defamation,' 'corrupting
                    youths,' and 'religious heresy,' I don't intend to entertain their cheap tricks, nor will I bother
                    defending myself. However, considering how this might allow everyone to better understand my
                    research, I'll briefly explain it.</i></p>
            <p><i>According to them, I committed the sin of academic defamation when I publicly disparaged the classic
                    research of Titan studies and parapsychology, claiming them to be 'a black tide of the academic
                    world.' Answer me this: Was my evaluation incorrect? A study about whether Titans can stand on the
                    head of a pin, and a study that posits the nature of souls as water. They persist until this day
                    because of certain authorities. How is that any different from a mental black tide?</i></p>
            <p><i>I studied in the Grove since I was a child, and thoroughly understand that the revolution of ideas can
                    only be achieved through criticism and suspicion. I encourage students to challenge my authority,
                    and this is what they claim to be 'corrupting youths.' Take Phainon and Castorice for example, when
                    they first began their studies, they were clueless about how to think and what logic is. Look at
                    them now, they can render me speechless sometimes! If this is what it means to 'corrupt' youths, I
                    cannot imagine what they regard as 'correct education.'</i></p>
            <p><i>As such, some individuals accuse me of having excessively close ties with the Flame-Chasing Chrysos
                    Heirs, claiming that my theories help them seize the Coreflames. Indeed, I once consulted Tribios
                    about lost history, and both of my most brilliant students happen to be Chrysos Heirs as well. And
                    what of it?</i></p>
            <p><i>I am also what they call a Chrysos Heir, but I've never have blind faith in prophecies. If gods are
                    truly the purest and most eternal beings that have ascended above the mortal world, then listen
                    well, the world only has one god, and that is the indestructible truth!
                    <br>Only disciples of truth can continue on this path, and the authorities who proclaim themselves
                    to be
                    sages fear the fall of god.</i></p>
            <p><i>You suggested that both parties take a step back to deescalate the situation... My apologies, but I
                    don't intend to do that. On the contrary, I would like to give a word of advice to those who wish to
                    accuse me—</i></p>
            <p><i>The future world will understand me, and all of you who raise accusations against me should be more
                    afraid than me when I await my verdict!"</i></p>

            <p><i>"Even up till today, I still disagree with that bizarre Flame-Chase Journey. However, there is one
                    statement that left a deep impression — Losses are a constant on the Flame-Chase journey.</i></p>
            <p><i>I never believed that the Chrysos Heirs shared the same destiny, but I am undoubtedly also on the path
                    of losses.
                    <br>Yet, I have not lost enough... In comparison to what I pursue, I have not lost enough to fulfill
                    the
                    law of equivalent exchange.</i></p>
            <p><i>After I had proposed the theory that the nature of souls of Titans and humans are no different, and
                    that souls are constructed from seeds of wisdom, I have been waiting for a chance to prove it once
                    and for all...
                    <br>Now, the opportunity has presented itself! It came rather unexpectedly, but also right on time.
                    <br>Today, I can finally make up for the regret, akin to a calamity, from numerous years ago.
                </i></p>
            <p><i>I gained inspiration from death, and should repay as such.
                    <br>My body shall become the vessel to forge the Coreflames of gods, and my soul shall become the
                    chains
                    that force the gods to bow. That will become the ultimate evidence for my theory!</i></p>
            <p><i>I am incredibly happy now.
                    <br>I once smiled like this, when I first created a mechanical bird that could fly in the sky. My
                    hands
                    once trembled like this, when I developed a new life through incubation.</i></p>
            <p><i>My future students, if you see these words, it proves that my endeavor has failed at the final step,
                    falling just before the break of dawn.
                    <br>Use my results to the fullest extent, and make me the subject of your research! Step over my
                    body
                    and take the torch from my hands. Use me as the firewood to ignite the flames that will bring light
                    to the truth!
                    <br>Do not fear blasphemy—
                    <br>It is already a sin to transcend the gods, so what if you become a god!"</i></p>
            <p><i>— One of the echoes in Anaxa's memories after the Grove had fallen, which vanished because nobody
                    discovered it</i></p>
